# Day 7: Laboratories

You thank the cephalopods for the help and exit the trash compactor, finding yourself in the familiar halls of a North Pole research wing.

Based on the large sign that says "teleporter hub", they seem to be researching teleportation; you can't help but try it for yourself and step onto the large yellow teleporter pad.

Suddenly, you find yourself in an unfamiliar room! The room has no doors; the only way out is the teleporter. Unfortunately, the teleporter seems to be leaking magic smoke.
