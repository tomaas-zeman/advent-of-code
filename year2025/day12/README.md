# Day 12: Christmas Tree Farm

You're almost out of time, but there can't be much left to decorate. Although there are no stairs, elevators, escalators, tunnels, chutes, teleporters, firepoles, or conduits here that would take you deeper into the North Pole base, there is a ventilation duct. You jump in.

After bumping around for a few minutes, you emerge into a large, well-lit cavern full of Christmas trees!
