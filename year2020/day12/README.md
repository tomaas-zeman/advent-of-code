# Day 12: Rain Risk

Your ferry made decent progress toward the island, but the storm came in faster than anyone expected. The ferry needs to
take evasive actions!

Unfortunately, the ship's navigation computer seems to be malfunctioning; rather than giving a route directly to safety,
it produced extremely circuitous instructions. When the captain uses the PA system to ask if anyone can help, you
quickly volunteer.
