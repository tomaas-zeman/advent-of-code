# Day 11: Seating System

Your plane lands with plenty of time to spare. The final leg of your journey is a ferry that goes directly to the
tropical island where you can finally start your vacation. As you reach the waiting area to board the ferry, you realize
you're so early, nobody else has even arrived yet!
