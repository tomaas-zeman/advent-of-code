# Day 6: Custom Customs

As your flight approaches the regional airport where you'll switch to a much larger plane, customs declaration forms are
distributed to the passengers.

The form asks a series of 26 yes-or-no questions marked a through z. All you need to do is identify the questions for
which anyone in your group answers "yes". Since your group is just you, this doesn't take very long.
