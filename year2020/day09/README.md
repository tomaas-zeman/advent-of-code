# Day 9: Encoding Error

With your neighbor happily enjoying their video game, you turn your attention to an open data port on the little screen
in the seat in front of you.

Though the port is non-standard, you manage to connect it to your computer through the clever use of several paperclips.
Upon connection, the port outputs a series of numbers (your puzzle input).

The data appears to be encrypted with the eXchange-Masking Addition System (XMAS) which, conveniently for you, is an old
cypher with an important weakness.
