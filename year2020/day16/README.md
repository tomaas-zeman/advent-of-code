# Day 16: Ticket Translation

As you're walking to yet another connecting flight, you realize that one of the legs of your re-routed trip coming up is
on a high-speed train. However, the train ticket you were given is in a language you don't understand. You should
probably figure out what it says before you get to the train station after the next flight.

Unfortunately, you can't actually read the words on the ticket. You can, however, read the numbers, and so you figure
out the fields these tickets must have and the valid ranges for values in those fields.
