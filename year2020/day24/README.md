# Day 24: Lobby Layout

Your raft makes it to the tropical island; it turns out that the small crab was an excellent navigator. You make your
way to the resort.

As you enter the lobby, you discover a small problem: the floor is being renovated. You can't even reach the check-in
desk until they've finished installing the new tile floor.

The tiles are all hexagonal; they need to be arranged in a hex grid with a very specific color pattern. Not in the mood
to wait, you offer to help figure out the pattern.

The tiles are all white on one side and black on the other. They start with the white side facing up. The lobby is large
enough to fit whatever pattern might need to appear there.
