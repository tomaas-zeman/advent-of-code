# Day 13: Shuttle Search

Your ferry can make it safely to a nearby port, but it won't get much further. When you call to book another ship, you
discover that no ships embark from that port to your vacation island. You'll need to get from the port to the nearest
airport.

Fortunately, a shuttle bus service is available to bring you from the sea port to the airport! Each bus has an ID number
that also indicates how often the bus leaves for the airport.
