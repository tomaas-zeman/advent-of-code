# Day 20: Jurassic Jigsaw

The high-speed train leaves the forest and quickly carries you south. You can even see a desert in the distance! Since
you have some spare time, you might as well see if there was anything interesting in the image the Mythical Information
Bureau satellite captured.

After decoding the satellite messages, you discover that the data actually contains many small images created by the
satellite's camera array. The camera array consists of many cameras; rather than produce a single square image, they
produce many smaller square image tiles that need to be reassembled back into a single image.
