# Day 19: Monster Messages

You land in an airport surrounded by dense forest. As you walk to your high-speed train, the Elves at the Mythical
Information Bureau contact you again. They think their satellite has collected an image of a sea monster! Unfortunately,
the connection to the satellite is having problems, and many of the messages sent back from the satellite have been
corrupted.
