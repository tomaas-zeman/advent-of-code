# Day 20: Pulse Propagation

With your help, the Elves manage to find the right parts and fix all of the machines. Now, they just need to send the
command to boot up the machines and get the sand flowing again.

The machines are far apart and wired together with long cables. The cables don't connect to the machines directly, but
rather to communication modules attached to the machines that perform various initialization tasks and also act as
communication relays.

Modules communicate using pulses. Each pulse is either a high pulse or a low pulse. When a module sends a pulse, it
sends that type of pulse to each module in its list of destination modules.
