# --- Day 21: Step Counter ---
You manage to catch the airship right as it's dropping someone else off on their all-expenses-paid trip to Desert Island! It even helpfully drops you off near the gardener and his massive farm.

"You got the sand flowing again! Great work! Now we just need to wait until we have enough sand to filter the water for Snow Island and we'll have snow again in no time."

While you wait, one of the Elves that works with the gardener heard how good you are at solving problems and would like your help. He needs to get his steps in for the day, and so he'd like to know which garden plots he can reach with exactly his remaining 64 steps.
