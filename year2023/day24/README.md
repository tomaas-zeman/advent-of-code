# Day 24: Never Tell Me The Odds

It seems like something is going wrong with the snow-making process. Instead of forming snow, the water that's been

Maybe there's something you can do to break up the hailstones?

Due to strong, probably-magical winds, the hailstones are all flying through the air in perfectly linear trajectories.
