# Day 14: Restroom Redoubt
One of The Historians needs to use the bathroom; fortunately, you know there's a bathroom near an unvisited location on their list, and so you're all quickly teleported directly to the lobby of Easter Bunny Headquarters.

Unfortunately, EBHQ seems to have "improved" bathroom security again after your last visit. The area outside the bathroom is swarming with robots!
